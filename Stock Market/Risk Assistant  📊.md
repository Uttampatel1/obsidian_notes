## C**alculate Risk for Stock**

- Value at Risk (VaR): The maximum loss a portfolio or investment may experience within a specified confidence level and time horizon. This example calculates VaR at a 95% confidence level.
    
- Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR): Also known as Expected Shortfall (ES), CVaR represents the expected loss beyond the VaR. It calculates the average loss of the worst-performing observations below the VaR threshold.
    
- Sharpe Ratio: The Sharpe Ratio is adjusted for the number of trading days in a year (assumed as 252 days). It measures the risk-adjusted return of an investment by considering the excess return over the risk-free rate divided by the standard deviation of excess returns.
    
- Maximum Drawdown: The Maximum Drawdown calculation remains the same as in the previous version.
    
- Sortino Ratio: Similar to the Sharpe Ratio, the Sortino Ratio is also adjusted for the number of trading days in a year (assumed as 252 days). It measures the risk-adjusted return of an investment by considering the excess return over the risk-free rate divided by the downside deviation, which only considers negative returns.
