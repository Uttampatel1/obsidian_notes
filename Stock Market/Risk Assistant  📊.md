# Calculate Risk for Stock

## Beta

Beta is a financial metric that measures the sensitivity of a stock's returns to changes in the overall market returns. It is a measure of systematic risk, which is the risk associated with the overall market movements that cannot be diversified away. Beta indicates how much a stock's price tends to move in relation to the broader market. 📈📉

The beta ratio is calculated using a regression analysis that compares the historical returns of a stock to the returns of a benchmark index, such as the S&P 500. The beta coefficient represents the slope of the regression line and quantifies the relationship between the stock's returns and the market returns. 📊

The beta ratio is typically interpreted as follows:

 - Beta > 1: The stock is expected to have a higher volatility than the market. It tends to move more than the market, amplifying both upward and downward movements. 📈🌪️
    
 - Beta = 1: The stock's volatility is similar to the market. It is expected to move in line with the market. 📈
    
 - Beta < 1: The stock is expected to have lower volatility than the market. It tends to be less volatile than the market, with smaller upward and downward movements. 📉
    
For example, a stock with a beta of 1.2 indicates that, on average, for every 1% change in the market, the stock's price is expected to change by 1.2%. 🔄💹

Investors use beta as a tool to assess a stock's risk and understand how it may behave in different market conditions. A higher beta implies higher risk but also potentially higher returns, while a lower beta indicates lower risk but potentially lower returns. It is important to note that beta is a historical measure and may not accurately predict future price movements. ⚠️🔮

## Maximum Drawdown

Maximum Drawdown is a ⬇️ risk metric that measures the largest percentage decline in the value of an investment or portfolio from a peak to a trough over a specific time period. It helps investors understand the potential downside risk and the magnitude of losses that can occur during a particular investment period.

To calculate the Maximum Drawdown, you need the historical price or value data of the investment. Here's how the calculation works:

1️⃣ Identify the peak value: Determine the highest value (peak) of the investment during the specified time period.

2️⃣ Identify the trough value: Find the lowest value (trough) of the investment that occurs after the peak.

3️⃣ Calculate the drawdown: Calculate the drawdown at each point in time by subtracting the current value from the peak value and dividing it by the peak value.

4️⃣ Find the maximum drawdown: Identify the largest drawdown percentage observed during the specified time period.

The Maximum Drawdown represents the peak-to-trough percentage decline and reflects the worst loss experienced by the investment during the specified time frame. It is expressed as a negative value or a percentage, indicating the extent of the decline from the peak.

For example, if an investment had a peak value of 💲10,000 and later dropped to a trough value of 💲6,000, the drawdown would be (💲6,000 - 💲10,000) / 💲10,000 = -0.4 or -40%. In this case, the Maximum Drawdown would be 40%.

Investors and fund managers utilize Maximum Drawdown as a measure of risk and downside potential. A smaller Maximum Drawdown indicates lower volatility and potential losses, while a larger Maximum Drawdown suggests higher volatility and potential losses during the specified time period. It is important to consider the Maximum Drawdown alongside other risk metrics to gain a comprehensive understanding of an investment's risk profile.


## Value at Risk (VaR)

- Value at Risk (VaR) is a ⚖️ risk metric that estimates the potential loss in value of an investment or portfolio over a specified time period and at a given confidence level. It provides an estimate of the maximum amount that could be lost with a certain probability under normal market conditions. 📉💰

- VaR is typically expressed as a negative value or a percentage of the investment value. For example, if a stock has a VaR of 5% at a confidence level of 95%, it means that there is a 5% chance of incurring a loss greater than the VaR amount within the specified time period. 📊📉💸

- The VaR metric helps investors and risk managers assess the potential downside risk of an investment or portfolio. By quantifying the potential loss, it aids in risk management and decision-making processes. However, it's important to note that VaR has limitations and assumptions, and it may not capture extreme events or unexpected market behavior. ⚠️🔍💡
    

## Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR)

- Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR), or Expected Shortfall (ES), is a 📉 risk metric that quantifies the average expected loss beyond the Value at Risk (VaR) level. It provides additional information about the severity of potential losses beyond the VaR threshold. 💼📊📉

- CVaR measures the average of all potential losses that exceed the VaR level, considering the tail end of the loss distribution. It gives investors a better understanding of the potential magnitude of extreme losses and the risk of large downside moves. 📉🔍⚠️

- CVaR is useful for risk management and decision-making as it goes beyond VaR by providing insights into the potential downside risks and their potential impact on portfolios or investments. It helps investors assess the potential severity of losses in extreme market conditions. However, like any risk metric, CVaR has limitations and assumptions that should be considered when interpreting the results. ⚠️🔍💡

## Sharpe Ratio

The Sharpe Ratio is a 📈📊 risk-adjusted performance measure that evaluates the excess return of an investment or portfolio per unit of risk. It helps investors assess whether the returns generated are adequately compensating for the level of risk taken. ⚖️🚀💼

The Sharpe Ratio is calculated by subtracting the risk-free rate of return from the average return of the investment or portfolio, and then dividing it by the standard deviation of returns. The higher the Sharpe Ratio, the better the risk-adjusted performance. 📊📈🔍💹

The Sharpe Ratio is widely used in finance to compare the performance of different investments or portfolios. It allows investors to gauge the efficiency of an investment strategy by considering both the returns earned and the volatility or risk involved. However, it's important to note that the Sharpe Ratio has limitations and assumptions, and it should be used in conjunction with other metrics and analysis. ⚠️🔍💡

## Sortino Ratio

- The Sortino Ratio is a 📉📊 risk-adjusted performance measure that focuses on the downside risk of an investment or portfolio. It considers the volatility of negative returns, also known as downside deviation, rather than the overall volatility. It helps investors assess the risk-return tradeoff and evaluate the effectiveness of an investment strategy in protecting against downside movements. ⚖️🚀💼

- The Sortino Ratio is calculated by subtracting the risk-free rate of return from the average return of the investment or portfolio, and then dividing it by the downside deviation. The downside deviation measures the standard deviation of only negative returns. A higher Sortino Ratio indicates a better risk-adjusted performance, specifically in relation to downside risk. 📉🔍📊💹

- The Sortino Ratio is particularly useful for investors who are more concerned about preserving capital and managing downside risk. It provides a more targeted assessment of risk and return, focusing on the potential for losses rather than overall volatility. However, similar to other risk-adjusted metrics, the Sortino Ratio has limitations and should be used in conjunction with other analysis and considerations. ⚠️🔍💡


## Logic

### recommendation logic is as follows:

- If the Sharpe Ratio is positive and the beta is positive:
    - If the VaR is less than 0.05 (5%), the Max Drawdown is less than 0.1 (10%), and the Sortino Ratio is greater than 1.0, the recommendation is set to 'Strong Buy' 🚀💪📈.
    - If the VaR is less than 0.1 (10%), the Max Drawdown is less than 0.2 (20%), and the Sortino Ratio is greater than 0.8, the recommendation is set to 'Buy' 💰📈.
    - Otherwise, the recommendation is set to 'Hold' 🤝🕒.
- If the Sharpe Ratio is not positive or the beta is not positive, the recommendation is set to 'Do Not Buy' ❌📉.
