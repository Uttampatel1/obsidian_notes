>  parameter explanation describes the various parameters present in the "Sst.csv" dataset. Let me explain each parameter in detail:

1.  Sr No - This is the serial number of the data point in the dataset.
2.  Parameter Name - This is the name of the parameter being recorded. In this case, it is the "Sensor".
3.  Sensor - This parameter specifies whether the data was collected by the Aqua or Terra surface sensor. Aqua is denoted by 1 and Terra is denoted by 2.
4.  Month - This parameter specifies the month in which the data was collected.
5.  Season - This parameter specifies the fishing season in which the data was collected. Spring is denoted by 1, summer is denoted by 2, fall is denoted by 3, and winter is denoted by 4.
6.  Time - This parameter specifies the time of the day when the data was collected. Morning is denoted by 1 and afternoon is denoted by 2.
7.  Lat - This parameter specifies the latitude of the location where the data was collected.
8.  Lon - This parameter specifies the longitude of the location where the data was collected.
9.  Sst - This parameter specifies the Sea Surface Temperature (SST) recorded at the location and time specified by the other parameters.

In summary, the "Sst.csv" dataset contains information about the location, time, and SST data collected by the Aqua and Terra surface sensors during different seasons and times of the day.


> parameter explanation describes the various parameters present in the "chl.csv" dataset. Let me explain each parameter in detail:

1.  Sr No - This is the serial number of the data point in the dataset.
2.  Parameter Name - This is the name of the parameter being recorded. In this case, it is the "Sensor".
3.  Sensor - This parameter specifies whether the data was collected by the Aqua or Terra surface sensor. Aqua is denoted by 1 and Terra is denoted by 2.
4.  Month - This parameter specifies the month in which the data was collected.
5.  Season - This parameter specifies the fishing season in which the data was collected. Spring is denoted by 1, summer is denoted by 2, fall is denoted by 3, and winter is denoted by 4.
6.  Time - This parameter specifies the time of the day when the data was collected. Morning is denoted by 1 and afternoon is denoted by 2.
7.  Lat - This parameter specifies the latitude of the location where the data was collected.
8.  Lon - This parameter specifies the longitude of the location where the data was collected.
9.  chl - This parameter specifies the chlorophyll level recorded at the location and time specified by the other parameters.

In summary, the "chl.csv" dataset contains information about the location, time, and chlorophyll data collected by the Aqua and Terra surface sensors during different seasons and times of the day. Chlorophyll is a green substance found in plants that helps them grow by absorbing light from the sun.


> parameter explanation describes the various parameters present in the "FishName.csv" dataset. Let me explain each parameter in detail:

1.  Sr No - This is just a serial number assigned to each row in the dataset.

2. Species Category - This parameter specifies the category of fish to which the species belongs. It can be based on various factors such as their size, habitat, etc.

3.  Scientific Name - This parameter specifies the scientific name of the fish species. It is a universal name for the species, recognized worldwide.

4.  English Name - This parameter specifies the original English language name of the fish species.

5.  Local Name - This parameter specifies the local language name of the fish species. It can be in the native language of the place where the fish is found.

6.  Min Temp - This parameter specifies the minimum temperature required for the fish species to survive.

7.  Max Temp - This parameter specifies the maximum temperature required for the fish species to survive.

8.  Mean Temp - This parameter specifies the mean temperature range in which the fish species can survive.

9.  Fish Temp In Category - This parameter divides the fish species into different temperature groups based on the temperature range they can survive in. There are six groups defined based on the temperature range specified in this parameter.

In summary, the "FishName.csv" dataset contains information about the different fish species, their scientific and local names, their temperature requirements for survival, and the temperature range groups to which they belong. This information can be used to predict the location where a particular fish species can be found based on the sea surface temperature data collected.
