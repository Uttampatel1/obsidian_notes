Neural networks can help computers make intelligent decisions with limited human assistance. This is because they can learn and model the relationships between input and output data that are nonlinear and complex. For instance, they can do the following tasks.

### Make generalizations and inferences

Neural networks can comprehend unstructured data and make general observations without explicit training. For instance, they can recognize that two different input sentences have a similar meaning:

-   Can you tell me how to make the payment?
-   How do I transfer money?

A neural network would know that both sentences mean the same thing. Or it would be able to broadly recognize that Baxter Road is a place, but Baxter Smith is a personâ€™s name.
